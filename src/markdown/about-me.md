Hey there!

I'm Arpita. I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm currently seeking Summer 2022 Internship oppurtunities. I have about 3 years of work experience in travel and pharma industries. I keep doing interesting things to keep myself busy! I am recently exploring UX and Visual Design as well. *Learning day by day stays the motto of my life!*
